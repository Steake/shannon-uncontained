## What Is This, Exactly?

Shannon-Uncontained is a **penetration testing orchestration framework** that treats security reconnaissance not as a checklist of tools, but as an exercise in **epistemic systems design**. We refuse to contain our observations in the stale categories of "finding" or "non-finding." Reality, as Hitchens might have noted, does not respect such convenient binaries.

Unlike other pentest frameworks that stuff their outputs into Docker containers (ah yes, the great equalizer of modern laziness), we operate **uncontained**. Our world model lives in the open—inspectable, falsifiable, and delightfully uncomfortable for those who prefer their security theater neatly packaged.

### The Core Proposition

Most security tools produce certainty. *They lie.*

A port scan that returns "open" tells you nothing about what lies behind it. A credential that works today may not work tomorrow. A vulnerability that exists in staging may be patched in production. Traditional tools flatten this rich epistemic landscape into boolean flags.

Shannon-Uncontained takes a different approach: every observation is encoded with its **belief**, **disbelief**, **uncertainty**, and **base rate**. We call this the **EQBSL tensor**—Evidence-Quantified Bayesian Subjective Logic—and it is the spine upon which our entire world model hangs.

---

## Philosophy (Or: Why We Built This)

### The Problem With Certainty

Most pentest reports read like religious proclamations: *"The system is vulnerable to SQL injection."* Full stop. No uncertainty. No provenance. No acknowledgment that the tester ran the payload three times on a Tuesday afternoon against a staging environment that shares approximately 40% of its codebase with production.

This is not science. This is **cargo cult security**.

### The EQBSL Alternative

We adopt the epistemic framework of [Evidence-Based Subjective Logic](./EQBSL-Primer.md), extended into tensor space with explicit operator semantics. Every claim in our world model carries:

| Component | Symbol | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Belief** | `b` | Confidence the claim is true |
| **Disbelief** | `d` | Confidence the claim is false |
| **Uncertainty** | `u` | Lack of evidence either way |
| **Base Rate** | `a` | Prior probability in similar contexts |

With the constraint: `b + d + u = 1`

The **expectation** `E = b + a·u` gives us a probability estimate that honestly accounts for what we don't know. Uncertainty only decreases as evidence accumulates. You cannot hand-wave it into nonexistence.

### Key Components

- **Recon Agents**: Orchestrate tools (nmap, subfinder, whatweb, etc.) and emit structured evidence
- **World Model**: Central knowledge graph of entities, claims, and relations
- **Epistemic Ledger**: Manages EQBSL tensors for all subjects; tracks uncertainty honestly
- **Evidence Graph**: Append-only store with content-addressed events and provenance
- **Budget Manager**: Resource constraints (time, tokens, network) to prevent runaway agents

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/Steake/shannon-uncontained.git
cd shannon-uncontained
npm install

# Generate reconnaissance for a target
./shannon.mjs generate https://example.com

# View the world model
./shannon.mjs model show --workspace shannon-results/repos/example.com

# Export interactive knowledge graph
./shannon.mjs model export-html --workspace shannon-results/repos/example.com --view provenance
```

### Graph View Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `topology` | Infrastructure network: subdomains → path categories → ports |
| `evidence` | Agent provenance: which agent discovered what evidence |
| `provenance` | EBSL-native: source → event_type → target with tensor edges |

---

## The Evidence-First Workflow

### 1. Reconnaissance Phase

Agents emit **evidence events** into the graph:

```javascript
{
  source: 'NetRecon',
  event_type: 'PORT_SCAN',
  target: 'example.com',
  payload: { port: 443, state: 'open', service: 'https' },
  timestamp: '2024-01-15T10:30:00Z'
}
```

### 2. Claim Derivation

Evidence supports **claims** with explicit confidence:

```javascript
{
  subject: 'example.com:443',
  predicate: 'runs_service',
  object: 'nginx',
  confidence: 0.85,
  evidenceIds: ['ev_a1b2c3', 'ev_d4e5f6']
}
```

### 3. EQBSL Tensor Assignment

Every claim carries a tensor: `(b, d, u, a)`

```javascript
// High-confidence claim from strong evidence
{ b: 0.82, d: 0.03, u: 0.15, a: 0.5 }
// Expectation: 0.82 + 0.5 × 0.15 = 0.895

// Low-confidence claim from weak evidence  
{ b: 0.20, d: 0.10, u: 0.70, a: 0.5 }
// Expectation: 0.20 + 0.5 × 0.70 = 0.55
```

### 4. Visualization

The knowledge graph renders edges styled by their epistemic state:
- **Color**: Cyan (high belief) → Yellow (uncertain) → Red (low belief)
- **Width**: Thicker edges = higher expectation
- **Opacity**: More opaque = less uncertainty

---

## Why "Uncontained"?

Because Docker containers are a confession of architectural defeat.

More seriously: traditional pentest tools often operate in isolated silos. Nmap knows nothing of what Burp discovered. Nuclei doesn't care what your manual testing revealed. Each tool produces its own artifact, and some poor analyst must stitch together a coherent narrative.

Shannon-Uncontained rejects this fragmentation. All evidence flows into a single world model. All claims reference their evidentiary basis. All uncertainty is tracked, not hidden.

We are uncontained in the sense that our knowledge refuses to be boxed, our uncertainty refuses to be denied, and our architecture refuses to pretend that security is a simple matter of running the right script.

## EQBSL In Practice

For the mathematically inclined, see [EQBSL-Primer.md](./EQBSL-Primer.md) for the complete specification.

The short version:

1. **Evidence is vector-valued**: Multiple channels (positive/negative) per observation
2. **Opinions derive from evidence**: `b = r/(r+s+K)`, `d = s/(r+s+K)`, `u = K/(r+s+K)`
3. **Decay is mandatory**: Evidence loses weight over time (configurable per channel)
4. **Propagation is explicit**: Transitive trust uses damped witness discounting
5. **Embeddings are deterministic**: ML-ready features derived reproducibly from state

## FAQ

**Q: Is this just another wrapper around existing tools?**

A: No. It's an epistemic framework that happens to orchestrate tools. The tools produce observations; we produce knowledge—with explicit uncertainty.

**Q: Why EQBSL instead of simple confidence scores?**

A: Because "80% confident" conflates two very different states: "I have strong evidence for yes" and "I have weak evidence both ways." EQBSL separates belief, disbelief, and uncertainty. This matters when making decisions.

**Q: Why the Hitchens quote?**

A: Because penetration testing is, at its core, an exercise in skepticism. We question the claims of system administrators, developers, and security vendors. Our evidence must be solid enough to survive cross-examination.

## Fork Acknowledgment

Shannon-Uncontained is a fork of [**Shannon**](https://github.com/KeygraphHQ/shannon) by [Keygraph, Inc.](https://keygraph.io/)

We gratefully acknowledge the original authors for building the foundation upon which this epistemic extension stands. The original Shannon project provided the pentest orchestration architecture; we have extended it with EQBSL-based uncertainty quantification, knowledge graph visualization, and a rather more skeptical worldview.

If you find value in the epistemic additions, consider also starring the [upstream repository](https://github.com/KeygraphHQ/shannon).
